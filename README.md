# Odin Project: Members Only

## What is this?

In this project, weâ€™ll be building an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write anonymous posts. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

## Reflections

Authentication and authorization is seemingly made easy with the Devise gem although this project only scratched the surface. With each mini-project I feel more comfortable working within the MVC pattern. For the next project I'm going to focus more on how to better utilize views and partials.
