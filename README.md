Odin Project: Members-Only
==========================

[ __[ LINK TO PROJECT SPECS PAGE ]__ ](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-members-only)

In this project, we will be building an exclusive clubhouse where members can write anonymous posts. When not logged in, users may view posted messages but will not know who wrote them. Once logged in, users will able to see both messages and the author of said message. 

__New concepts to apply:__
* Authorization vs authentication
* Devise gem, logging in, logging out
* Rails form helpers
* Testing with RSpec (System & Model)

How it's made:
-------------

*Tech used:* HTML, CSS, Ruby on Rails, RSpec

Although not stipulated in the Odin curriculum, I decided to go back and revisit this project in order to add some tests. I learned testing concepts from www.codewithjason.com and I will be using RSpec to write and run the tests, as RSpec appears to be a more complete testing suite than the built-in Mini-Test.

Lessons learned:
