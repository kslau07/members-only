## Description

In this project, youâ€™ll be building an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write anonymous posts. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

## My goals

We've been learning about cookies, authentication, and authorization. I hope to implement some of the techniques learned to be able give users "stateful" sessions all while keeping the app safe from potential security holes.
